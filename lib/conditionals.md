# What is a conditional?

Are if, else, elsif, and case statements.  It a way for the program to evaluated true/false, boolean statements in a structure sequence.  
Basically, if the first condition is met (true), do this, but if its false go to the next condition, and so. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

= - sets a value or tells a variable to point to an object
== - is asking if two objects are equal to one another
